# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The project was an analysis of Kickstarter campaigns in the "Play" parent category based on their respective launch dates and funding goals.
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the success or failure of Kickstarter plays based on the launch date and fiscal goals of each project.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The analysis was performed by using Excel functions to chart the outcomes of theater campaigns based on launch date to find the distribution of failed, successful, and canceled campaigns. A line chart was then created as a visual to easily display the percentages of outcomes for each month.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The analysis was performed by using Excel functions to chart the outcomes of theater campaigns based on the amount of the stated Kickstarter goal. The pledged goals were broken up into 12 goal subcategories, with the less than $1000 pledged category starting first and aso having the highest percentage of successful campaigns. A line chart of this data was then created to show the percentage of failed, successful, and canceled campaings relative to how much money the stated Kickstarter goal was.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One of the challenges encountered involved gathering data from the dataset without including the live campaigns, or campaigns currently running. This was overcome by using Excel functions to filter the data for live campaigns and not include them in the analysis. Another one of the challenges that could be encountered in the dataset was that the majority of data points in the successful outcomes based on goals set were under $5000, showing that it is hard to get accurate data and a good sample size for pledged goal amounts over $5000. If we were to want this specific data, we should run a separate analysis showing the difference in goal amounts above and below $5000. We can show this with separate line graphs showing the visual difference when the separate dataset is used.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
One conclusion you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch date is that May is the most successful month to launch a Kickstarter theater campaign. Another conclusion you can draw is that May also has the most failed Kickstarter theater campigns. Therefore, you can also conlude that May is the most popular time to start a Kickstarter theater campaign in general. Also, you can conclude that you have the highest chance to succeed launching a theater campain in May, but also the highest chance to fail. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
You can conclude that setting a campaign goal for a play will have the highest chance of succeeding if you keep the goal to under $1,000. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The limitations of the dataset include not factoring in the current live Kickstarter campaigns that could already have met or succeeded their goals, and the launch date of each and how it will factor into the whole dataset. The data also does not show how quickly he campaign succeeded or failed to meet their goals.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create another graph showing the length of each successful campaign and make an additional graph showing the length of each succesful campaign based on the launch date. We can do this by referencing the launch date and deadline date, as well as the outcomes column to figure out average length of time for successful and failed campaigns.
